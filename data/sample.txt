Black as a Racial Classification

Black is a racial classification commonly based on political, social, and skin-color categories. It is typically used to describe populations with mid- to dark-brown complexions. In many Western societies that use socially constructed systems of racial classification, the term refers to people perceived as darker-skinned compared to others. It is most often applied to individuals of sub-Saharan African ancestry, as well as Indigenous Australians, Melanesians, and Negritos. However, the label has been used in numerous contexts for various groups and does not indicate any close ancestral relationship. Additionally, not all people considered Black have dark skin; features such as facial structure and hair texture are also commonly associated with the classification. In contrast, many Indigenous African societies traditionally did not identify themselves using the term Black until the influence of Western cultures introduced it.

Social Construction and Variability

Modern anthropologists and scientists acknowledge biological differences among human populations, but they view the concept of a distinct Black race as a social construct rather than a biological category. Criteria for determining who is considered Black differ across societies, and these standards have changed over time. In many regions, factors beyond skin tone—such as cultural identity, ancestry, or historical status—affect classification. Some individuals perceive the term as outdated, derogatory, or unrepresentative, particularly in African nations without a history of colonial racial segregation, and therefore choose not to identify with it.

Usage in Different Regions

In English-speaking countries, the meaning of the term varies significantly. In the United States, person of color is widely used and accepted, while the term colored person is considered offensive, except in South Africa, where Coloured refers specifically to people of mixed-race ancestry. In Australia and Melanesia, European settlers historically applied the label black to Indigenous populations. In Australia, the term was generally offensive until the 1960s and 1970s and was typically used as an adjective rather than a noun. After the 1967 referendum and the progress of desegregation, some Indigenous Australians adopted the term in a manner influenced by its usage in the United States, though it remains controversial.

Capitalization and Style Guides

Several American style guides, including the AP Stylebook, adopted the capitalization of the B in Black following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. However, not all style authorities agree; for example, the ASA Style Guide does not recommend capitalizing the term.
